'We can expect that to entrench as nobody likes to be proved wrong, so the optimum strategy is to polarize Leave versus Remain so that pro-soft Brexit blocs can't get traction. The majority of Conservative and UKIP voters want a hard Brexit, of course. That's even more the case if we only look at paid-up members of the parties. Our recommendation is this: forget about the centre, tack to the right and pursue a hard Brexit. Few of your voters will even consider Labour at the moment. Even its own voters are giving up on it having any clear stance on Brexit. So hoover up UKIP's vote with promises of grammar schools and a return to the 1960s.'",
